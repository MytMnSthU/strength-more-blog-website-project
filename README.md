### Features

1. **Front-end Focused**: The primary focus of the project is to create a robust and user-friendly front-end interface for blog content presentation and interaction.

3. **Dynamic Content Rendering**: Blog posts and data are dynamically fetched and rendered on the website using GraphQL queries, allowing for real-time updates and smooth content delivery.

4. **Responsive Design**: The website ensures a responsive layout, making it accessible and user-friendly across various devices.
